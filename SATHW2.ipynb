    "# The code simulates the Monty Hall problem, where a car is hidden behind one of three doors, and the player must choose a \n",
    "# door. The host then opens another door that doesn't contain the car. The player is given the option to either switch to \n",
    "# the remaining unopened door or stay with their initial choice.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Key steps in the code:\n",
    "# 1. Import the `random` module for making random selections.\n",
    "# 2. Define the `monty_hall` function, which takes the number of simulations as input (default is 10,000).\n",
    "# 3. Initialize counters to track wins when switching and staying.\n",
    "# 4. Run a loop for the specified number of simulations:\n",
    "#    - Randomly place the car behind one of the three doors.\n",
    "#    - The player randomly selects a door.\n",
    "#    - The host opens a door that does not have the car and wasn't picked by the player.\n",
    "#    - Determine the door to which the player would switch. \n",
    "#    - Check if switching or staying wins and update counters accordingly.\n",
    "# 5. Calculate and return the probabilities of winning by switching and staying.\n",
    "# 6. Print the results, demonstrating that switching doors generally results in a higher probability of winning (about 2/3) \n",
    "# compared to staying (about 1/3).\n",
